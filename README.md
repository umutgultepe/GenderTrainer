GenderTrainer
=============

A program using PCA and LBH algorithms to generate feature sets for a gender recognition software which works with frontal face photos. Outputs the feature properties in XML format to be used by the GenderTester software which is also included in my repositories. 

OpenCV and Eigen libraries are utilized. Program is only built and tested on Linux, however it should work on other systems as well with modifications on file handlers.
