GenderTrainer
=============

A gender trainer program using PCA and LBH algorithms. Outputs the feature properties in XML format to be used by the GenderTester software which is also included in my repositories. 

OpenCV and Eigen libraries are utilized. Program is only built and tested on Linux, however it should work on other systems as well with modifications on file handlers.
